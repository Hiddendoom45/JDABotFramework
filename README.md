# JDABotFramework(WIP)

A Wrapper around the JDA api that allows for some slightly more advanced functionallity. Designed to have 
the typical minimal functions for a bot like a ping command, a prefix, command parsing mod commands vs regular commands.

Based off of the code written for FFBEBot with the same base features such as a counter/progress indicator, message spam limitor, etc.
Designed to be more modular with the ability to add/remove different components with ease. 

Currently a WIP wherein all interfaces are not finalized and may be subject to change as I adapt it.

For an example of a bot using this interface see the [SearchBotv2 repository](https://github.com/Hiddendoom45/SearchBotv2)

## API documentation 

Will not be added until it is in a more finalized state
